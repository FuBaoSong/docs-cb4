    <p>Couchbase Server 5.1.x fortifies the 5.x series to improve reliability, stability, and security of the product. Take a look at <xref href="../introduction/whats-new.dita">What's new</xref> for a list of new features and
      improvements that are available in the 5.1.x series.</p>
    
    <section id="release-511">
      <title>Release 5.1.1</title>
      <p>Couchbase Server 5.1.1 was released in June 2018. This is the first maintenance release in
        the 5.1.x series of Couchbase Server and includes important bug fixes applicable to all
        prior 5.x releases. We recommend that you upgrade to the 5.1.1 release and deploy these important bug fixes.</p>
      <p id="upgrading-to-511"><b>Upgrading to Version 5.1.1</b></p>
      <p>Since most Couchbase Server upgrade procedures involve rebalance,
        some care must be taken when upgrading from a version prior to 5.1.1 to avoid
        being affected by <xref href="https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29959"
          format="html" scope="external">MB-29959</xref>. Specifically, graceful failover
        and/or remove+rebalance should not be used to start this upgrade. As such, there
        are a few best practice approaches: <ol>
          <li>Add a net-new node of at least 5.1.1 to any existing cluster first. This new
            node will become the orchestrator and any further rebalance will not be
            affected. From then on, follow the instructions in <xref
              href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/online-upgrade"
              >Performing an Online Upgrade</xref>. </li>
          <li>If a net-new node is not available, a hard failover can be performed on any node, that
            node upgraded to 5.1.1 and then re-added to the cluster. This is only required for the
            first node and, as per #1 above, any further rebalance operations will not be affected.
            From then on, follow the instructions in <xref
              href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/online-upgrade">Performing
              an Online Upgrade</xref>.</li>
          <li>As XDCR is not affected by MB-29959, upgrading one cluster in a
            multi-cluster setup is also supported. Ensure that no writes are going to the
            cluster during its upgrade unless following the approaches listed in #1 or #2
            above. For instructions, see <xref
              href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/intercluster"
              >Upgrade Using Inter-cluster Replication</xref>.</li>
          <li>Offline upgrade will not be affected. For instructions, see <xref
            href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/offline"
            >Performing the Offline Upgrade</xref>.</li>
        </ol></p><p>Which method is best for your cluster will depend on your architecture
          and organization’s requirements (for example, SLAs, extra hardware/cluster
          availability, and so on). Once a cluster is upgraded to 5.1.1 or later, this
          guidance no longer applies and any supported upgrade method may be used going
          forward.</p>

              <entry>The cbbackupmgr utility failed to backup directly from couchstore-files when the bucket was created on a version prior to 4.6 and threw the following error: 
                “<systemoutput>error: could not read couchstore file due to unsupported file format version; exception: unpack requires a string argument of length 18</systemoutput>” </entry>

              <entry>Couchbase Server version 5.0 introduced a new storage system “plasma” available only in the Enterprise Edition. When using the Enterprise Edition, you had a choice of “plasma” or “forestDB” for storage and the default was set to “plasma”. Since “plasma” storage was not available in the Community Edition, no storage was allocated when other services were started. This has been fixed and the default storage in the Community Edition now points to ForestDB. </entry>

              <entry>From the Query Monitoring tab, sorting the completed requests on the “run at” column did not appear to work as expected. This was because the “run at” column did not display the date, making the result of the sorting operation appear incorrect, since the same time on two different dates would appear in different spots on the list. This has been fixed by adding a clickable tooltip to the “run at” time which displays the complete time including the date. </entry>
